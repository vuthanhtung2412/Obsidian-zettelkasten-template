# Usage guide

## Obsidian hotkeys

- Ctrl + p : command list
- Ctrl + o (this should be map to `Ctrl + O` since `Ctrl + o` is taken by vim) : Open file by title, if the title doesn't exist create new note. Use this over `Ctrl + n`.

## Zettelkasten

### How to tag

1. Tags should neither be vague nor specific
2. Personalize your tags
3. Keep the number of tags below 4

### How to use `Tags` folder

1. This folder is used to **gain insights and navigating** to your network of notes.
2. When a tags (a subject) get large enough, It worth reviewing it and make a note to find common ideas.

### How to take note

1. You first start by creating a blob (if exist). Make sure to rename the blob.
2. Then you can create atomic notes for this source. Some questions to address are :
    1. So what ?
    2. Why does it matter ?
    3. What does this mean ?
3. Keep note short-ish
4. Note should be about only 1 single idea
5. Make sure to always use your own words

`#TODO` : notes that I have knowledge about and I need to finished it
`#BackLog` : Ideas I have but don't know how yet
`#RabbitHoles` : Ideas I would like to visit again if I have time but it is take way to much time.
